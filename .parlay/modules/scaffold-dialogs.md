_Scaffold dialog templates from intents_

# Scaffold Dialogs

Generate complete dialogs from authored intents, and update existing dialogs when intents change.

## Arguments

- `feature`: The feature slug (e.g., `upgrade-plan-creation`)

<!-- parlay:active-root-aware -->
## Active root

Every relative path below is interpreted against the **active root** — the parlay project root resolved by the CLI from cwd, the `--root` flag, or `PARLAY_ROOT`. The CLI handles resolution; this skill describes paths abstractly. Two categories matter:

- **Active-root paths** (`.parlay/build/`, `spec/intents/`, etc.) live under whichever root the CLI resolves to.
- **Repo-level-root paths** (`.parlay/schemas/`, `.parlay/adapters/`, the deployed agent surface) live only at the repo-level root. When the active root is a child, the CLI loads these from the parent automatically.

When invoking the CLI, pass `--ambiguity-as-signal` on commands that might face an ambiguous active root. If a CLI invocation exits with code 11 and emits a JSON envelope on stderr (`{"kind":"ambiguity",...}`), the root cannot be guessed — the candidates are real projects, and picking one writes into the wrong tree.

Who resolves it depends on where you are running. If you own the user interaction — the loop driver, or a skill the user invoked directly — prompt with the listed candidate roots and re-invoke with `--root <chosen>`. If you are a **phase module** running inside a subagent, you have no interactive tool: return an `ambiguity` decision request listing the candidates as options and let the driver ask.

## Asking the user

This skill runs as a **phase module** — normally inside a parlay-loop subagent, where no interactive tool exists. A question asked there is written into a transcript nobody reads, and you then answer it yourself; that is not a confirmation, it is a decision made on the user's behalf. So do not prompt. **Stop and return a decision request** as your final output. The driver prompts and resumes you with the chosen `id`, with your context intact, so you continue exactly where you stopped.

````
```yaml parlay-decision
kind: phase-boundary        # phase-boundary | override | overwrite | failure | ambiguity
phase: <the phase you are in>
question: "<the one question, in the user's terms>"
context: |
  <what you found, and what is already on disk>
options:
  - id: <slug>
    label: "<what the user picks>"
    detail: "<the consequence, when it isn't obvious>"
resume: "Re-enter with decision: <id>. <what is written so far>"
```
````

Leave the filesystem coherent before you stop — a decision is a pause, not a half-write. If you genuinely cannot pause at that point, take the option that preserves the user's work, never the one that destroys it, and say so in your report.

Two things not to do: never narrow the options to spare the user a question, and never resolve an ambiguity by taking the reading that is cheapest to implement. Both turn a decision the user should own into one you made quietly.

## Steps

1. **Read feature files**:
   - `spec/intents/{feature}/intents.md`
   - `spec/intents/{feature}/dialogs.md` (may not exist yet)

2. **Check for ambiguities** — Before generating, scan each intent for ambiguities that would affect the dialog (unclear Goal, contradictory Constraints, missing Context for branching decisions). If found, raise an `ambiguity` decision request BEFORE generating anything (see **Asking the user**). Do not generate dialogs with gaps, and do not resolve an ambiguity by picking the reading that is easiest to write a dialog for.

3. **Generate dialogs for uncovered intents** — For each intent that has no matching dialog:
   - Read the intent's Goal, Context, Action, Constraints, Verify, and Objects
   - Generate a complete dialog flow: trigger, happy path with user/system turns, branches for each Constraint that implies user-visible behavior, branches for each Verify item that describes an edge case
   - The generated dialogs should be complete enough that the designer can review and approve with minor edits — not empty templates requiring rewriting
   - Run `parlay create-dialogs @{feature}` for the mechanical scaffolding, then enrich each template with full content

4. **Update existing dialogs** — For intents that already have dialogs, compare each dialog against its current intent:
   - For new Constraints: generate a complete `#### Branch:` section with user turn, system response, and any sub-branches
   - For new Verify edge cases: generate a complete branch showing the edge case flow
   - For renamed intents: propose updating the dialog heading
   - Skip cosmetic changes (rewording that preserves meaning)
   - Raise one decision request carrying every proposed update: the triggering intent change and the complete proposed content for each, with a per-update option id
   - `dialogs.md` is designer-authored — modify it only after that decision comes back

5. **Report** — Summarize: how many dialogs were generated, how many updates were proposed, how many were accepted/skipped. If everything is current: "Dialogs are up to date — no updates needed."
